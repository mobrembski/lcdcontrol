LCDControl - Very simple LCD2USB control application.

Basicly, this is a modified LCD2USB example application from:

http://www.harbaum.org/till/lcd2usb/index.shtml

Main goal for this project is to bringup a tool for setting contrast,
brightness, fade-int and fade-out LCD2USB enabled screen.
This application is useful for ex. To fade-out display when shutting
down computer.

To compile, just type make.
It uses libusb, so libusb with development headers needs to be instaled.
